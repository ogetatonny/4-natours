This project is as a result of collaboration between:
1. Tony Ogeta and
2. Edwin Ogechi

Tourism is one of the major revenue generating avenues for most countries in the world. The tourists, however, are faced with challenges booking the touring sites of interest. From our research, some of the challenges tourists face include: slot management, book cancellation, getting the price per booking in real time and managing bookings by calendar among others.

In attempt to address these challenges, we developed interest in developing an application (Natours) that will help eliminate them. We dwelled on the APIs. The API does CRUD operations. We did testing via postman to affirm this behavior.

The technologies used included:
1. IDE - Visual Studio code
2. Programming Language - JavaScript(nodeJS)
3. Framework - express, morgan
4. Database - mongoDB(Atlas)
5. Operating System - windows
6. Version control - Github
7. API tool - Postman

The successes of this project: 

1. Teamwork
2. Debugging
3. Testing
4. Project management

The challenges of the project:

1. Time
2. Resource utilization(data bundles/WiFi)
3. Budgeting for some tools
4. Machine configuration(office machine)


Software development for this project was a mixture of fatigue and fun.
Fatigue and demanding as it requires a fully fledged product
Fun seeing the outcome being the intended one.
We have also learnt the agile project methodologies which we adhered to throughout the product development process.
We still look forward to more learning opportunities. 
Thanks to ALX for giving as such a wonderful platform to learn.
